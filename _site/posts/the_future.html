    <h1>The Past n' Future of RatLegion.com</h1>
<p>I first came up with the idea of this very website a bit over 2 years ago sort of loosely based around a in-joke I had with a friend group. The website was a very basic page that could've been made in the 90s with links to other pages mostly filled with images. At that time I was a total noob to html, css. So I mostly just used ChatGPT(which had launched a couple months prior), to write it. Over time I eventually built my skills till I no longer needed it and could rely on documentation instead. That website now only exists on my hard drive, and it will stay that way. But its idea lived on.</p>
<p>Much later I wanted to make a rat themed game(don't question), I started to get into the <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot game engine</a>, and I built a simple platformer game with a rat as the protagonist. I wanted a domain to host that game on so I looked around and thought &quot;ratlegion.com&quot; sounded interesting, so I bought it. (Although in hindsight I now probably would've prefered ratlegion.net or ratlegion.land instead.) I didn't do much with it, and later I gave up working on the game. But I imagined what I could've done.</p>
<p>Then, I was researching for a free online personality quiz maker, however I noticed that every single one saved the result in the cloud, which usually meant it was not free. I however thought I could try and make my own that saves all data in the url itself (such as <a href="beepbox.co">BeepBox</a>). I got to work coding, it is the most complicated thing I've made, and it took a full month before it even worked. <a href="../quiz/editor.html">But it does!</a> I needed a website to host it on of course. And no website is complete without a nice domain. Hey wait! I have a nice domain! So I put it on my GitHub, and after lots of struggling, got my domain to work. This was also a perfect excuse to finally give ratlegion a homepage as it had deserved so long ago.</p>
<p>And that's where we are right now. Based on this trajectory so far, I don't think ratlegion is going end up how I want it too unless I make a change. So what do I want to do with this site? Well, in essence I want to turn it into a modernized version of a flash game site (featuring a rat theme). As of now this website is just a personal website/project dump and I need to make some major redesigns to accommodate both the quiz maker part as well as all the fun stuff I want to add. Once I do, maybe I'll even finish that rat platformer game that started this.</p>
