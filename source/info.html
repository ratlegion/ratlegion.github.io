        <summary>what?</summary>
        <pre>
in previous websites, much of the image assets
were generated using dall-e 2 or similar.

i didn't care much about it then,
it was just sillyness with a new technology.
but my perception of ai art has grown negitive
as it is being used professionally to suck the fun
out of art and that makes me feel sad :&lpar;

i don't like where this technology is headed,
i personally don't have a problem with using it
for debugging, but when it starts to encroach on
my art, just no.
