# Planning and Ideas

It's been a while since the last update, I've moved the site to [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) with frustration, so adding anything should be much easier. I don't know how important that will come in play with how I've been coding things.

Anyways, I've got a pretty good document of what I want this website to be. It's going to be a bit of a blend of a point and click style game, and a topdown rpg(you can see my progress on building the rpg engine [here](https://github.com/ratlegion/RPG-Web)). Not sure if I'll be able to complete the technical part, but either way I think the artistic part is the larger fish.
